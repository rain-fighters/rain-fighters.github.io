# Rain-Fighters
## Bridging gaps within the realm of feasibility
You are using some (probably closed source) software and desperately wish for a particular feature to be implemented, but nobody listens and you feel like a dog left out in the rain? We are *Rain-Fighters* and might be able to help you. 

## LibreWare
Whenever we are able to help, we will publish our solution as **Open Source** licensed under **GPL 3.0** on **GitHub**. You will never have to pay for any *libreware/rain-fighters* product, but you will have the **liberty** to pay for it (throw some money to the creators). Any such voluntary payment is **a tip** and **not a donation**. It's income for the creators and taxes apply. We take pride in paying our taxes but hate how complicated tax legislation sometimes is.

## Privacy
**Privacy** and **Liberty** go hand in hand. If you want to contact us, feel free to do so. We will never abuse the fact that you install our software, to contact you, store or even spread/sell any information about you. End of message.
