# Rain-Fighters

## LibreWare
Whenever we are able to help, we will publish our solution as **Open Source** licensed under **GPL 3.0** on **GitHub**. You will never have to pay for any *libreware/rain-fighters* product, but you will have the **Liberty** to pay for it (throw some money to the creators). Any such voluntary payment is **a tip** and **not a donation**. It's income for the creators and taxes apply. We take pride in paying our taxes but hate how complicated tax legislation sometimes is.

## Privacy
**Privacy** and **Liberty** go hand in hand. If you want to contact us, feel free to do so. We will never abuse the fact that you install our software or visit our web site(s), to contact you or to even spread/sell any information about you, unless you explicitly ask for it. We use Google Analytics and Google Search (SEO) to figure out how many people are interested in what we do, where they come from and how much they engage (so-called "conversion" == bullshit-bingo-phrase for "buy and not only look").
