# Rain-Fighters
## Bridging gaps within the realm of feasibility
So, you are using some (probably closed source) software and desperately wish for a particular feature to be implemented. But nobody listens and you feel like a dog left out in the rain? We are *Rain-Fighters* and might be able to help you. 

## LibreWare
Whenever we are able to help, we will publish our solution as **Open Source** licensed under **GPL 3.0** on **GitHub**. You will never have to pay for any *libreware/rain-fighters* product, but you will have the **liberty** to pay for it (throw some money to the creators). Any such voluntary payment is **a tip** and **not a donation**. It's income for the creators and taxes (we take pride in paying) apply.
